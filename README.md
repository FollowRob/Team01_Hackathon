#  NewbieToNinja

## Description

<u>NewbieToNinja</u> is a website that provides information about becoming a Jr. Developer. It is primarily targeted at members of the public who are looking to start a career in tech/full-stack development. Users of the site will be able to take a quiz on the subject of full-stack development (questions will be relevant for beginners) and <u>**be able to access information about beginning their journey and sign up for an email newsletter.**</u>

## UX

### Layout

The site layout was created using wireframes and done in [Canva](https://canva.com/)

A minimal and clean layout was chosen to avoid any overstimulation on the understanding that neurodivergence is a common occurence within the tech community.

### Colour palette

The website uses relatively bright colours with some darker ones used for both contrast and accessibility. The aim was to keep the colour scheme as light and friendly as possible as we want users to associate positivity with their desire to learn to code.

The colour palette was selected by utilising both ChatGPT and [Coolors](https://coolors.co/). The colours were chosen for their aesthetic appeal and readability.
Colours chosen were:

- #263238 **Primary Colour - Deep blue-grey: complements coding-photo backgrounds, modern and tech-focused.**
- #1a1a1a **Secondary Colour - Near-black for strong text contrast.**
- #797979 **Tertiary Colour - Light gray for hovered buttons etc.**
- #d84315 **Accent Colour - Highlight colour, used for incorrect answers.**
- #4bad3c **Accent Colour Two - Another highlight colour, for correct messages.**
- #ffffff **Background Colour - Pure white for maximum readability.**
